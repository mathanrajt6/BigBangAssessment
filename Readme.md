# **BigBang Assessment - Hotel Booking System**

## Welcome to the Hotel Booking System repository! 
 &nbsp; &nbsp;This system is designed to help users easily book hotel rooms. It follows a Microservice architecture, which means it consists of multiple smaller services that work together to provide a seamless booking experience.

- The system consists of three main microservices: HotelAPI, UserAPI, and BookingAPI.
- Each microservice handles specific functionalities related to hotels, users, and bookings, respectively. 
- The system provides CRUD operations for various entities, such as Hotel, Room, Amenity, and Reservation.
-- Additionally, it includes filtering and counting operations to facilitate efficient data retrieval.
